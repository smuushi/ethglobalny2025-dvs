# ColdCache - Decentralized Video Game Store Implementation Guide

## Project Overview

ColdCache is a revolutionary platform that gives gamers true ownership of their
digital games through NFTs, eliminates censorship, and enables full resale
rights. Built on Sui blockchain with Walrus storage integration.

## Problem Statement

- **Censorship**: Games purchased on platforms like itch.io can be deleted due
  to payment processor issues
- **No Resale Rights**: Digital games cannot be resold, eliminating secondary
  markets and community resources like libraries
- **Platform Monopolies**: Consumers have zero control over their digital
  purchases, developers forced to accept 30% platform cuts

## ColdCache Solution

- **True Ownership**: Game purchases mint NFTs that prove ownership forever
- **Censorship Resistance**: Games stored on decentralized Walrus storage
- **Resale Rights**: NFT ownership enables peer-to-peer game transfers
- **Developer Friendly**: Minimal platform fees, just gas costs

## Core Features Implementation

### 1. Store View - Game Catalog and Purchase

**Location**: `/src/pages/Store.tsx` (to be created)

**Key TODOs**:

- [ ] Integrate with Sui Move contract to fetch available games
- [ ] Implement game purchase flow (mint NFT)
- [ ] Add RadixUI components for modern game store UI
- [ ] Add search, filtering, and pagination
- [ ] Integrate with Walrus for game cover images

**Sui Integration** (building on your current pattern):

```typescript
// Following your CreateCounter.tsx pattern
import { useSignAndExecuteTransaction, useSuiClient } from "@mysten/dapp-kit";
import { Transaction } from "@mysten/sui/transactions";

const gameStorePackageId = useNetworkVariable("gameStorePackageId");

const { data: availableGames } = useSuiClientQuery("getOwnedObjects", {
  owner: gameStorePackageId,
  filter: { StructType: `${gameStorePackageId}::game_store::Game` },
});

const { mutate: purchaseGame } = useSignAndExecuteTransaction();

const handlePurchase = (gameId: string, price: string) => {
  const tx = new Transaction();

  tx.moveCall({
    target: `${gameStorePackageId}::game_store::purchase_game`,
    arguments: [tx.pure.string(gameId)],
    coins: [tx.splitCoins(tx.gas, [parseInt(price)])],
  });

  purchaseGame({ transaction: tx });
};
```

### 2. Library View - Owned Games and Downloads

**Location**: `/src/pages/Library.tsx` (to be created)

**Key TODOs**:

- [x] Query owned game NFTs from Sui
- [x] Implement real-time NFT ownership verification
- [x] Implement download progress tracking
- [x] Direct Walrus CDN downloads using QuiltPatchId
- [ ] Integrate Seal for token-gated decryption
- [ ] Add game transfer/gift functionality

**Sui + Walrus + Seal Integration**:

```typescript
const downloadGame = async (game: OwnedGame) => {
  // 1. Verify NFT ownership on Sui (implemented in GameDownloadManager)
  const downloadManager = new GameDownloadManager(
    suiClient,
    currentAccount.address,
  );

  // 2. Download game file from Walrus CDN
  const gameBlob = await downloadManager.downloadGame(game, (progress) => {
    setDownloadProgress({
      stage: progress.stage,
      progress: progress.progress,
      message: progress.message,
    });
  });

  // 3. Trigger browser download
  const filename = `${game.title.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "_")}.zip`;
  GameDownloadManager.triggerDownload(gameBlob, filename);
};

// GameDownloadManager handles:
// - NFT ownership verification via Sui queries
// - Direct Walrus CDN download using QuiltPatchId
// - Future Seal decryption integration
// - Progress tracking and error handling
```

### 3. Publisher Portal - Game Upload and Registration

**Location**: `/src/pages/Publisher.tsx` (to be created)

**Key TODOs**:

- [x] Upload games to Walrus using @mysten/walrus WalrusFile
- [x] Register games on Sui Move contract with rich metadata
- [x] Handle metadata (cover images, descriptions, genres)
- [ ] Integrate Seal NFT-based access policies for encryption
- [ ] Publisher analytics and earnings tracking

**Current Walrus Upload Flow** (implemented in GameUpload.tsx):

```typescript
const publishGame = async (gameFile: File, metadata: GameMetadata) => {
  // 1. Upload game file to Walrus using WalrusFile
  const walrusFile = WalrusFile.from({
    contents: new Uint8Array(await gameFile.arrayBuffer()),
    identifier: gameFile.name,
    tags: { contentType: gameFile.type },
  });

  const flow = walrusClient.writeFilesFlow({ files: [walrusFile] });
  await flow.encode();

  // Register and upload to storage nodes
  const registerTx = flow.register({
    epochs: 5,
    owner: currentAccount.address,
  });
  const registerResult = await signAndExecute({ transaction: registerTx });
  await flow.upload({ digest: registerResult.digest });

  // Certify the upload
  const certifyTx = flow.certify();
  await signAndExecute({ transaction: certifyTx });

  const files = await flow.listFiles();
  const patchId = files[0].id; // QuiltPatchId for CDN downloads

  // 2. Register on Sui contract with all metadata
  const tx = new Transaction();
  tx.moveCall({
    target: `${gameStorePackageId}::game_store::publish_game_entry`,
    arguments: [
      tx.object(gameStoreObjectId),
      tx.pure.vector(
        "u8",
        Array.from(new TextEncoder().encode(metadata.title)),
      ),
      tx.pure.vector(
        "u8",
        Array.from(new TextEncoder().encode(metadata.description)),
      ),
      tx.pure.u64(Math.floor(parseFloat(metadata.price) * 1000000000)),
      tx.pure.vector("u8", Array.from(new TextEncoder().encode(patchId))), // Walrus QuiltPatchId
      tx.pure.vector(
        "u8",
        Array.from(new TextEncoder().encode(coverImagePatchId)),
      ),
      tx.pure.vector(
        "u8",
        Array.from(new TextEncoder().encode(metadata.genre)),
      ),
      // Additional file metadata...
    ],
  });

  signAndExecute({ transaction: tx });
};

// Future Seal Integration:
// 3. Create Seal policy for token-gated access
// 4. Encrypt game file before Walrus upload
// 5. Store Seal policy ID in NFT for decryption verification
```

## Move Smart Contract Implementation

### GameStore Contract (Sui Move)

**Location**: `/move/game_store/sources/game_store.move`

**Key TODOs**:

- [ ] Create new Move package for game store
- [ ] Implement game publishing with Seal policy integration
- [ ] Implement NFT minting for purchases
- [ ] Add real-time ownership verification for Seal
- [ ] Implement transfer tracking and royalties

**Core Move Contract** (replacing your counter.move):

```move
module game_store::game_store {
    use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};
    use sui::sui::SUI;
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::object::{Self, UID, ID};
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};
    use std::string::String;

    /// Game information stored on-chain
    public struct Game has key, store {
        id: UID,
        title: String,
        description: String,
        price: u64,
        publisher: address,
        walrus_id: String,        // Encrypted game on Walrus
        seal_policy_id: String,   // Seal access policy ID
        cover_image_id: String,
        genre: String,
        publish_date: u64,
        is_active: bool,
    }

    /// NFT representing game ownership
    public struct GameNFT has key, store {
        id: UID,
        game_id: ID,
        owner: address,
        purchase_date: u64,
    }

    /// Game store registry
    public struct GameStore has key {
        id: UID,
        admin: address,
        games: vector<ID>,
    }

    /// Publish a new game
    public fun publish_game(
        _store: &mut GameStore,
        title: String,
        description: String,
        price: u64,
        walrus_id: String,
        seal_policy_id: String,
        genre: String,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    ): ID {
        let game = Game {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            title,
            description,
            price,
            publisher: tx_context::sender(ctx),
            walrus_id,
            seal_policy_id,
            cover_image_id: std::string::utf8(b""),
            genre,
            publish_date: tx_context::epoch(ctx),
            is_active: true,
        };

        let game_id = object::id(&game);
        transfer::share_object(game);
        game_id
    }

    /// Purchase a game (mint NFT)
    public fun purchase_game(
        game: &Game,
        payment: Coin<SUI>,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    ): GameNFT {
        assert!(coin::value(&payment) >= game.price, 0);

        // Transfer payment to publisher
        transfer::public_transfer(payment, game.publisher);

        // Mint NFT to buyer
        let nft = GameNFT {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            game_id: object::id(game),
            owner: tx_context::sender(ctx),
            purchase_date: tx_context::epoch(ctx),
        };

        nft
    }

    /// Verify game ownership (called by Seal)
    public fun verify_game_ownership(
        nft: &GameNFT,
        game_id: ID,
        owner: address
    ): bool {
        nft.game_id == game_id && nft.owner == owner
    }

    /// Transfer game NFT (automatic access transfer)
    public fun transfer_game(nft: GameNFT, to: address) {
        transfer::public_transfer(nft, to);
        // Access automatically transfers with NFT - Seal verifies on next download
    }
}
```
