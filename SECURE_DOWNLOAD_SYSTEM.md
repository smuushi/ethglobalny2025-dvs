# üîê ColdCache Secure Download System

## Overview

The ColdCache Secure Download System ensures that **only authenticated wallet
users with verified NFT ownership** can download games, even if they have direct
access to Walrus CDN links.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### 1. **Wallet Authentication Required**

- Users must connect their Sui wallet before accessing any download
- No anonymous downloads allowed
- Connection status is verified on every download attempt

### 2. **NFT Ownership Verification**

- Downloads are gated by blockchain-verified NFT ownership
- Multiple verification methods:
  - Exact NFT ID match
  - Game ID match
  - Walrus blob ID match (for shared game files)
- Real-time ownership checking via Sui blockchain queries

### 3. **Secure Backdoor URLs**

- Protected URLs: `/download/:gameId`
- Can use NFT ID, Game ID, or Walrus blob ID as identifier
- URLs can be shared but still require authentication

### 4. **Access Control Logging**

- All download attempts are logged with:
  - Timestamp
  - Game ID (truncated for privacy)
  - User address (truncated for privacy)
  - Success/failure status
  - Reason for denial
  - User agent information

## üìã Implementation Details

### Routes

- **Public Route**: `/download/:gameId` - Accessible to anyone but requires
  authentication
- **Authentication**: Automatic wallet connection check
- **Authorization**: NFT ownership verification via smart contract queries

### Security Components

#### `SecureDownloadPage.tsx`

- Main download authentication page
- Handles wallet connection requirements
- Performs NFT ownership verification
- Provides user-friendly error messages
- Implements actual secure download flow

#### `secureDownload.ts` Utility Library

- `generateSecureDownloadUrl()` - Creates protected download URLs
- `logSecureDownloadAttempt()` - Security logging for all attempts
- `validateTemporaryAccessToken()` - Optional token-based security
- `SECURE_DOWNLOAD_HEADERS` - Additional security headers

#### Updated Pages

- **LibraryPage**: Now uses secure download links instead of direct downloads
- **GameDetailPage**: Redirects to secure download flow
- **App.tsx**: Added `/download/:gameId` route

## üîÑ Download Flow

### 1. **User Clicks Download**

```typescript
// From Library or Game Detail page
const secureUrl = generateSecureDownloadUrl(game);
window.location.href = secureUrl;
```

### 2. **Secure Download Page Loads**

- Checks if wallet is connected
- If not connected: Shows wallet connection UI
- If connected: Proceeds to ownership verification

### 3. **NFT Ownership Verification**

```typescript
// Query user's owned NFTs from both contracts
const [gameStoreNFTs, nftContractNFTs] = await Promise.all([
  queryGameStoreNFTs(),
  queryNFTContractNFTs(),
]);

// Check ownership via multiple methods
const ownsGame = gameStoreNFTs.some(
  (nft) =>
    nft.id === gameId || nft.gameId === gameId || nft.walrusBlobId === gameId,
);
```

### 4. **Access Decision**

- ‚úÖ **Access Granted**: Shows game details + secure download button
- ‚ùå **Access Denied**: Shows error message + link to store
- ‚è≥ **Loading**: Shows verification progress

### 5. **Actual Download**

- Uses existing `GameDownloadManager` for:
  - NFT ownership re-verification
  - Walrus CDN download
  - Progress tracking
  - File decryption (when Seal is enabled)

## üö´ Security Protections

### Against Direct CDN Access

- Even with Walrus aggregator URLs, users must go through secure download flow
- No way to bypass NFT ownership verification
- All download attempts logged for security monitoring

### Against URL Sharing

- Shared URLs require recipient to:
  - Connect their own wallet
  - Own the required NFT
- No session hijacking possible
- No anonymous access allowed

### Against Replay Attacks

- Real-time blockchain ownership verification
- No cached permissions
- Fresh queries on every download attempt

## üéØ Example URLs

```typescript
// Secure download URLs (all require authentication)
/download/0xe0e9a170a7c0899a6f0008792444d48efe9084ff458c2511e32f277278bdf905  // NFT ID
/download/0x00d37bf31c80633ae021705b4ded59caa1a75fa10051a5f5f1710dccf525ada8  // Game ID
/download/9_0OcvP-0O58WdbDOev_mDZieY7SJv6HHCvkYuXI7GYBAQAOAg  // Walrus Blob ID
```

## üìä Security Logging

All download attempts are logged with this format:

```typescript
{
  timestamp: "2024-12-19T10:30:00.000Z",
  gameId: "0xe0e9a170a7c0...",
  userAddress: "0x0aa501c0bdb6...",
  success: true,
  reason: "Redirecting to secure download",
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)..."
}
```

## üéÆ User Experience

### For Legitimate Users

1. Click download in Library/Game Detail
2. Automatic redirect to secure page
3. Instant verification (already connected + own NFT)
4. One-click secure download
5. Progress tracking + success message

### For Unauthorized Users

1. Click shared download link
2. Prompted to connect wallet
3. Ownership verification fails
4. Clear error message + link to purchase
5. Cannot access game files

## üîß Configuration

### Security Headers

```typescript
const SECURE_DOWNLOAD_HEADERS = {
  "X-Requested-With": "ColdCache-Secure",
  "X-Download-Source": "Protected-NFT-Gate",
  "Cache-Control": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate",
  Pragma: "no-cache",
  Expires: "0",
};
```

### Access Token Security (Optional)

- Temporary access tokens for additional security
- 5-minute expiration by default
- Server-side validation recommended for production

## üöÄ Benefits

### For Publishers

- **True DRM**: Only NFT owners can download games
- **Resale Control**: Downloads tied to NFT ownership
- **Usage Analytics**: Track who downloads your games
- **Piracy Prevention**: No way to bypass ownership checks

### For Players

- **Legitimate Access**: Seamless downloads for owned games
- **Transparent Security**: Clear feedback on access status
- **Cross-Device**: Download from any device with your wallet
- **Resale Ready**: Downloaded games tied to transferable NFTs

### For Platform

- **Security Monitoring**: Complete audit trail of all downloads
- **Compliance**: Proper access controls for content distribution
- **Scalability**: Works with any number of games/users
- **Integration Ready**: Compatible with existing Seal encryption

## üîê Integration with Seal

When Seal encryption is enabled:

1. Secure download page verifies ownership
2. Downloads encrypted game from Walrus
3. Uses `seal_approve` functions in smart contract
4. Decrypts game client-side with verified keys
5. **Double protection**: Access control + encryption

This ensures that even if someone bypasses the download gate, they still cannot
access the encrypted game files without proper NFT ownership verification
through Seal.
